Calendar Synchronization Architecture

This module defines the architecture for synchronizing calendars across different environments,
including isolated networks accessible only via VPN or Remote Desktop.

Architecture Overview:
---------------------

1. Central Calendar Service:
   - Main FastAPI microservice running on the Next.js application server
   - Manages authentication with calendar providers (Google, Microsoft)
   - Provides unified API for calendar operations
   - Maintains synchronization state and handles conflicts

2. Remote Calendar Agents:
   - Lightweight agents that run in isolated environments
   - Connect to local calendars or calendar services within their network
   - Securely transmit calendar data to the central service
   - Support various platforms: Python, Node.js, PowerShell, PowerAutomate

3. Synchronization Protocol:
   - REST-based communication protocol between agents and central service
   - WebSocket-based real-time updates when available
   - File-based synchronization for highly restricted environments
   - Message queue for reliable delivery in unstable network conditions

4. Security Model:
   - Encrypted communication using TLS
   - Token-based authentication for agents
   - Credential isolation (agents only have access to their own environment)
   - Optional end-to-end encryption for sensitive calendar data

5. Synchronization Flow:
   - Bidirectional sync between source calendars and unified calendar
   - Conflict resolution based on configurable rules
   - Incremental updates using delta tokens and sync markers
   - Periodic full synchronization for consistency checks
