# Voice to Claude Code Examples

This document contains example voice commands for the Voice to Claude Code assistant. These examples showcase different capabilities and increase in complexity, perfect for demonstrating the tool in a YouTube video.

## Example 1: Simple File Creation

**Voice Command:**
> "Hey Claude, create a simple hello world script that prints the current date and time too."

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Basic file creation
- Using Claude Code to generate a simple Python script
- Voice-triggered coding assistance

## Example 2: Searching and File Analysis

**Voice Command:**
> "Claude, search this project directory for any Python files and tell me how many lines of code are in each file."

**What It Demonstrates:**
- File system navigation using voice
- Using Claude Code's search tools (GlobTool, Bash)
- Data aggregation and reporting
- Handling multi-step tasks with a single voice command

## Example 3: Bug Fixing and Code Analysis

**Voice Command:**
> "Hey Claude, take a look at the hello_world.py file and check if there are any bugs or potential improvements. If you find any, please fix them and explain what you changed."

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Code review capabilities
- Bug identification and fixing
- Combining both analysis and action
- Educational explanations of code changes
- Reading and modifying existing files

## Example 4: Feature Implementation

**Voice Command:**
> "Claude, add a command-line argument parser to hello_world.py that accepts a --name parameter. When provided, it should greet that name instead of saying 'world'. Make sure to include help text and error handling."

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Complex feature implementation using voice
- Understanding of programming concepts (CLI arguments)
- Integration with existing code
- Comprehensive implementation including documentation and error handling
- Navigating file contents and making precise modifications

## Example 5: Multi-File Project Development

**Voice Command:**
> "Okay Claude, I want to start a new command-line utility project. Create a new directory called 'weather_cli' with a modular structure including a main.py, a weather API client module, a command parser module, and a simple config file. The tool should allow users to check the weather for a location specified as an argument. Include proper error handling, logging, and a README file explaining how to use it. Don't implement the actual API calls, just create a skeleton with placeholder functions and detailed comments."

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Complex multi-file, multi-module project creation
- Advanced software architecture planning through voice
- Project scaffolding with proper structure
- Documentation generation
- Command-line interface design
- Error handling implementation
- Project organization best practices
- Working with multiple dependencies and components

These examples can be used in your video to demonstrate the increasing capabilities of voice-controlled coding with Claude Code, from simple scripts to complex project structures.
